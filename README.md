# CV
Hi, I’m Mejra —
cybersecurity analyst by profession,
builder by obsession,
and creative mind by nature.

This CV lives on GitHub because my work does too.
Every project here is something I actually built, tested, or used in real life — not just something I wrote on paper.

Some people say:
“You’re not an engineer if you don’t have a portfolio.”

So instead of arguing, I built one.
